For your final project you will creating an “unessay” on a topic of your choosing related to the history of the western United States. An "unessay" consists of any format besides a traditional final paper. You can create a sculpture, restaurant menu, board game, meme collage, podcast episode, piece of historical fictional - whatever you want! Regardless of the format, your unessay will be evaluated on the quality of its **interpretation**, **research & evidence**, **communication**, and **creativity**. Unessays must present a historically based analysis or interpretation that is supported by both primary and secondary sources. The interpretation must be clearly and compellingly articulated (written, painted, sung, etc.), and the very best unessays will take a creative approach to conveying their analysis. 

Each unessay must include: 

- A 500-word introduction that provides an overview and explanation of the project's interpretation. Think of this as the written text you might read at the start of a museum exhibit.
- An annotated bibliography of primary and secondary sources, in which you explain how the source informed your unessay in 1-2 sentences.

**Due Sunday, November 24th by 11:59PM**
