For your final project you will creating an “unessay” on a topic of your choosing related to the history of the western United States. An "unessay" consists of any format besides a traditional final paper. You can create a sculpture, podcast episode, restaurant menu, board game, meme collage, website, piece of historical fictional - whatever you want! Regardless of the format, the major requirement is that you must present a historically based analysis and interpretation that is supported by both primary and secondary sources. The interpretation must be clearly and compellingly articulated (written, painted, sung, etc.) and incorporate some kind of historical perspective. The very best unessays will demonstrate not only solid analysis, but creativity in how that interpretation is presented. 

Each unessay will include: 

- A 300-500 word introduction that provides an explicit overview and explanation of the project and its interpretation.
- An annotated bibliography of primary and secondary sources
