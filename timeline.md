Select a particular location and create a timeline of its history. How you define the location is  up to you. It can be a particular building (the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas), street (San Francisco's Mission Street), neighborhood (Compton), geological feature (the Grand Canyon), or community (Vail Ski Resort). The goal of this assignment is to offer a historical narrative or interpretation about this place, **NOT** simply a description of things that happened. Much of your effort should go into **curation**, or selecting events/people/episodes/etc. that tell some kind of coherent story about the place and its history. Some questions to consider: What was this place's significance? How does understanding this place help us understand larger themes about the U.S. West?

You will be submitting a digital timeline made using the Knight Lab's [Timeline.js](https://timeline.knightlab.com/). We will be going over how to create the timeline in class, but there are also plenty of [tutorials](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/sites/default/files/inline-pdfs/timelinejs_tutorial_0.pdf) [online](https://innovate.suny.edu/openmedialab/distribute/timeline-js/).

Your timeline must include:

- An introductory slide with a title, image, and 300-400 word introduction. This should introduce the reader to the place, provide any necessary background information, and lay out a clear narrative or interpretation.
- **Six entries** on the timeline. Each entry should have:
  - 100-125 words of text that provide descriptive information and fit it within the larger narrative
  - Image with caption and image credits (who made the image and where you found it)
  - Source(s) you used for the entry
- Submit a functional link to your timeline via email to <c.blevins@northeastern.edu>.
